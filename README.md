# Stream API Java - Exercises

For all the exercises, consider the following list of integer numbers:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 5, 4, 3);
```

- Exercise 1 - Show the list in numerical order:

Create a program that uses the Stream API to sort the list of numbers in ascending order and display it in the console.

- Exercise 2 - Print the sum of the even numbers in the list:

Using the Stream API, add the even numbers in the list and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 3 - Check if all the numbers in the list are positive:

With the help of Stream API, check if all the numbers in the list are positive and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 4 - Remove all odd values:

Use the Stream API to remove odd values ​​from the list and print the resulting list to the console.

- Exercise 5 - Calculate the average of numbers greater than 5:

With the Stream API, calculate the average of numbers greater than 5 and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 6 - Check if the list contains any number greater than 10:

Use the Stream API to check if the list contains any numbers greater than 10 and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 7 - Find the second largest number on the list:

With the help of Stream API, find the second largest number in the list and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 8 - Add the digits of all the numbers in the list:

Using the Stream API, add the digits of all numbers in the list and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 9 - Check if all the numbers in the list are distinct (not repeated):

With the Stream API, check that all numbers in the list are distinct (not repeated) and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 10 - Group odd values ​​that are multiples of 3 or 5:

Use the Stream API to group odd values ​​that are multiples of 3 or 5 and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 11 - Find the sum of the squares of all the numbers in the list:

Using the Stream API, find the sum of squares of all numbers in the list and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 12 - Find the product of all the numbers in the list:

With the help of Stream API, find the product of all numbers in the list and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 13 - Filter the numbers that are within a range:

Use the Stream API to filter numbers that fall within a specific range (for example, between 5 and 10) and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 14 - Find the largest prime number in the list:

With the Stream API, find the largest prime number in the list and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 15 - Check if the list contains at least one negative number:

Using the Stream API, check if the list contains at least one negative number and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 16 - Group the numbers into odd and even numbers:

Use the Stream API to group numbers into two separate lists, one containing the even numbers and one containing the odd numbers from the original list, and display the results in the console.

- Exercise 17 - Filter the prime numbers in the list:

With the help of Stream API, filter the prime numbers from the list and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 18 - Check if all the numbers in the list are the same:

Using the Stream API, check if all numbers in the list are the same and display the result in the console.

- Exercise 19 - Find the sum of numbers divisible by 3 and 5:

With the Stream API, find the sum of numbers in the list that are divisible by both 3 and 5 and display the result in the console.


### Instructions:
- Each Exercise must be implemented in separate classes in the same package.
- Exercises can be executed individually from the main methods of each class.
- Use the Stream API to implement the operations requested in each Exercise.
